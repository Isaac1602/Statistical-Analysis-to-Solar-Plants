# Statistical-Analysis-to-Solar-Plants


This repository contains a comprehensive statistical analysis focused on improving the efficiency and understanding of data from a solar energy plant. Using Python's powerful data manipulation and visualization libraries, the goal of this project is to uncover insights from operational data.

**Key Features**

- Data Manipulation: Clean and preprocess large datasets using pandas and numpy.
- Statistical Testing: Perform normality tests and regression analysis with statsmodels to evaluate data trends and patterns.
- Visualizations: Utilize matplotlib, seaborn, and holoviews to create insightful plots and interactive dashboards, allowing for a more intuitive exploration of the data.
- Interactive Analysis: With cufflinks, this project includes interactive visualizations to better understand the relationships within the dataset.


**Notable Libraries**

- pandas and numpy for data manipulation
- matplotlib and seaborn for static visualizations
- statsmodels for regression and hypothesis testing
- scipy for statistical analysis


**Project Objectives**

1. Understand the Distribution: Use normality tests to assess the distribution of key variables.
2. Explore Relationships: Visualize and quantify relationships between energy production and other influencing factors.
3. Optimize Performance: Provide insights on how to enhance the performance of solar plants based on statistical findings.

**Future Work**

This analysis can be extended to incorporate machine learning models for predictive analytics, enabling forecasting of solar energy production based on weather conditions and other external factors.
